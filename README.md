# Canadian-Monetary-Policy-Analysis
As a course project at the University of Toronto, my team and I used a VAR (Vector Autoregressive) model to forecast key factors in the Canadian economy. Furthermore, using our forecast as a base along with qualitative considerations we crafted a monetary policy suggestion to the Canadian Central Bank for the October 30th, 2019 interest rate decision.
